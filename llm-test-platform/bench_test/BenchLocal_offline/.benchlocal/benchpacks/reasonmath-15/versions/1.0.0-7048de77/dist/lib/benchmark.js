Rules:
- Show concise visible work using equations, short bullet points, or numbered steps.
- Do not write a long essay.
- End with exactly one line that starts with "ANSWER: ".
- If the question asks for more than one value, format the final line as semicolon-separated key=value pairs.
- Use exact arithmetic when possible.
- Round only the final result when the problem context requires it.
- If the constraints are inconsistent, say so explicitly in the final answer.`;
