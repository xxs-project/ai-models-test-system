# BenchLocal

Practical benchmarks for LLMs. Run them, build them, share them.

BenchLocal is a desktop app for running, comparing, and managing LLM Bench Packs.

Official Bench Packs today:

- ToolCall-15
- BugFind-15
- DataExtract-15
- InstructFollow-15
- ReasonMath-15
- StructOutput-15
- HermesAgent-20

BenchLocal owns the shared desktop runtime:

- provider configuration
- model registry
- Bench Pack install and update flow
- per-tab sampling overrides
- run execution and result history
- verifier lifecycle management
- persisted desktop UI state

Each Bench Pack owns its benchmark behavior:

- scenario definitions
- benchmark-specific prompts
- scoring logic
- verifier contracts where required
- benchmark-specific traces and summaries
